Greedy Algorithms Module
=========================

Overview
--------
Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices
hoping to achieve global optimum.

Problems Covered
----------------
1. Activity Selection
2. Job Sequencing
3. Huffman Coding
4. Fractional Knapsack

Key Greedy Pattern
------------------
1. Sort data based on some parameter
2. Pick best possible option at each step
3. Do NOT reconsider previous choices

Time Complexity
---------------
Mostly O(n log n) due to sorting.

Where Greedy Works
------------------
- Scheduling problems
- Compression (Huffman)
- Optimization with fractional choices
- Interval problems

Interview Importance
--------------------
Very common in:
- Amazon
- Google
- Microsoft
- Product-based companies
